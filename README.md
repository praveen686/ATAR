# Genie-Trader

(In Progress - Personal Project Not all features are available, these are targets and guides for contributors. To be updated as the project develops)


Welcome to the Genie Trader GitHub repository! Here you'll discover our innovative algorithmic and statistical modeling
platform designed for traders. Genie Trader is a microservice system that expertly manages intricate processes, creating
a seamless and self-consistent environment.

ðŸ˜‚In all seriousness, in its early stages, our platform is focusing on providing modular code that allows experienced developers and
traders to create customized pipelines. As the project evolves, we plan to expand and incorporate scalable cloud-based
solutions and end-to-end integration with various APIs.

We invite and appreciate contributions from everyone, regardless of the scale or scope. Thank you for visiting our
repository, and we're excited to collaborate with you on this groundbreaking project!

## [Quick Start Guide to the codebase for New Contributors](TEMPORARY_GUIDE_TO_EARLY_STAGE_CONTRIBUTIONS.md)

This repository is currently in its early development stage, and while a
lot of code has been written, some modules lack proper documentation. The aim of this project is to optimize the
codebase and convert it into microservices while incorporating good CI/CD practices and automating most tasks along
the way.

[TEMPORARY_GUIDE_TO_EARLY_STAGE_CONTRIBUTIONS.md](TEMPORARY_GUIDE_TO_EARLY_STAGE_CONTRIBUTIONS.md)

[USED_LIBRARIES_EXPLAINED.md](USED_LIBRARIES_EXPLAINED.md) (In Progress)

*note: Links to submodules are currently being displayed in the [USED_LIBRARIES_EXPLAINED.md](USED_LIBRARIES_EXPLAINED.md) and will soon be included in
the pip installation in [all] and [**DEP] format* Some will not be directly used in this codebase and might be part of a submodule that is used e.g. OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc. are used in ContentAdvisor; and may be moved to their respective repos as the codebase is converted into microservices.

## [Microservices](MICROSERVICES_BEST_PRACTICES.md)

We are working in transitioning the current codebase into a microservice architecture, thus keep modularity in mind even
if not directly contributing to the microservices. The microservices maintenance will be the primary focus of the repo
in the future. The current codebase is a bit of a mess and will be cleaned up as the microservices are developed. By no means am I referring to only the current definition of microservices (lambdas/cloud-run/etc...); just old-fashioned modular environments with loosely coupled components and a message bus or CLI will suffice.

### CodeGens, Clients and API's Creation

#### [SAM CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)

The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides
shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. With just a few lines per resource,
you can define the application you want and model it using YAML. During deployment, SAM transforms and expands the SAM
syntax into AWS CloudFormation syntax, enabling you to build serverless applications faster.

SAM CLI provides a Lambda-like execution environment that lets you locally build, test, and debug applications defined by SAM templates or through the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). You can also use the SAM CLI to deploy your applications to AWS, or create secure continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that follow best practices and integrate with AWS' native and third party CI/CD systems.

#### [OpenAPI Specification Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification.git)

[OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator.git) allows the generation of API client libraries (
SDK generation), server stubs, documentation, and configuration automatically given
an [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (both 2.0 and 3.0 are supported). Currently, the
following languages/frameworks are supported:

The data is currently stored in the data folder but will move towards database storage.

The data outside the subdirectories contain example data with 1 minute periods to get you started. However, the
subdirectories contain typically tick data, which is the most accurate data for backtesting; whether it will serve you
during your training process will depend heavily on your target labeled feature and resources available. The data is
stored in the following format:

## Project Focus: Code Integration, Review, and Optimization with Microservices Architecture

### Integration and Review

In the early stages of the project, our primary focus is to integrate and review the existing codebase to create a
cutting-edge algorithmic trading platform using a microservices' architecture. We will:

1. Consolidate all scattered code from different branches and repositories.
2. Ensure consistent coding standards and practices across the entire codebase.
3. Design and implement a microservices architecture that enables modularity, flexibility, and scalability.
4. Identify and address potential security vulnerabilities within each service.

### Optimization with Microservices

Identify the different functionalities and services provided by your code.
Group related functionalities into separate microservices, keeping in mind the principles of loose coupling and high
cohesion.

#### Design your microservices:

Define clear interfaces and APgenI contracts for each service.
Determine the data storage requirements for each service and decide whether to use a shared database or a separate
database per service.

#### Choose AWS services for deployment and management:

AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for container orchestration.
AWS Lambda for serverless, event-driven functions.
API Gateway to manage and expose your APIs securely.
Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, or other AWS database services for data storage.

#### Set up CI/CD pipelines:

AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to automate the build, test, and deployment process for each
microservice.

#### Implement monitoring and logging:

Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
Set up alarms and notifications to alert you when there are issues with your services.

#### Implement security best practices:

Secure your microservices with proper authentication and authorization using Amazon Cognito or a custom solution.
Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Collaboration and Communication

We encourage active collaboration among team members through:

1. Shared communication channels. (In Progress)
2. Regular virtual meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.
3. Utilizing a project management tools for task tracking and prioritization.
4. Creating and maintaining comprehensive documentation to support onboarding and knowledge sharing, including
   documentation for each microservice.
