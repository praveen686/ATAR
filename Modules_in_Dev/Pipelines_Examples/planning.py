# Outputs from Genie __> [R parameters] * [Sim Metrics "Features"]
# Currently this module assumes that only one asset
# Wanted to have parameter sensitivity report and tbl trained model done here but will split and later on combine into
#   another pipeline which makes better use of resources and the flow of operations like backtests
#   Thus here the ag model is trained on what is believed to be the optimal parameter combinations (which are passed)
#   For now only one parameter combination and asset are used (will be expanded on) and will not optimize
# todo Awaiting Triple_Barrier_Meta_Label and Autogluon Modules to be up to date
