Title: Temporary Guide to Contributing to the Project

# SUMMARY - Contributing 
We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project! Please read through the following guidelines before you begin to ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process.

Step 1: Fork the Repository
To get started, fork the repository to create your own copy, where you can make changes without affecting the original project. This will allow you to submit your changes as a pull request later on.

Step 2: Create a New Branch
After forking the repository, create a new branch in your fork to work on your changes. This will help keep your work organized and make it easier to merge your changes with the original project later.

Step 3: Make Your Changes
Feel free to work on any independent sections of the codebase or create new files as needed. Please ensure that your changes are in line with the project's objectives and maintain a high standard of quality. Keep in mind the importance of using common sense when making changes to the codebase.

Step 4: Document Your Work
Properly document your work by adding clear and concise comments to your code, as well as any necessary documentation for new features or modifications. This will help others understand your changes and ensure that they can be easily integrated into the main project.

Step 5: Submit a Pull Request
Once you have completed your work, submit a pull request to the original repository. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your changes, including any issues you encountered and how you resolved them. Please be precise in your description, especially when suggesting changes to files that you do not own.

Step 6: Addressing Issues
Feel free to add issues to the repository as needed. When submitting an issue, please provide a clear and concise description of the problem or recommended changes. If the issue pertains to a file that you do not own, be particularly precise in your description to help the file's owner understand the issue and implement the necessary changes.

Contributing.md (In Progress)
Please note that we are currently working on a detailed contributing.md file that will provide more in-depth instructions for contributors. In the meantime, we ask that you follow the guidelines outlined above to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We look forward to working with you and building something great together.
