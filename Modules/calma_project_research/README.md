## Fair Valuation of Cryptocurrency Futures:

For a model tailored to cryptocurrency futures like perpetuals, we need to account for unique market characteristics
such as the perpetual nature of contracts, the funding rate, and the pronounced volatility.
The goal in this paper is to outline a model that incorporates these elements by extending beyond the Black–Scholes
framework

### Model Framework

1. **Spot-Futures Parity Adaptation**: The spot-futures parity relationship must be adapted for cryptocurrencies to
   account for the funding rate (\(F\)) in perpetual futures, which aligns futures prices with spot prices over time.

2. **Modified Black–Scholes for Crypto Futures**:
   The classic Black–Scholes model needs to be adjusted to factor in the continuous funding rate for perpetual futures
   and the absence of a fixed expiration date.

### 1. Spot-Futures Parity Adaptation

For a standard futures contract, the spot-futures parity relationship is given by:

$$
F = S e^{(r - q)T}
$$

Where:

- \(F\) is the futures price,
- \(S\) is the spot price,
- \(r\) is the risk-free rate,
- \(q\) is the dividend yield,
- \(T\) is the time to maturity.

In the context of cryptocurrency, \(q\) could be replaced by the cryptocurrency staking yield or set to 0 if not
applicable, and \(r\) adjusted to reflect the crypto-specific yield or borrowing cost.

### 2. Continuous Funding Rate for Perpetual Futures

Perpetual futures contracts adjust the traditional futures pricing model by incorporating a continuous funding rate,
which can be positive or negative, paid between long and short positions to anchor the futures price to the spot price.
This can be integrated into the model as an ongoing cost or yield (\(c\)):

$$
F = S e^{(c)T}
$$

Where \(c\) is effectively the net impact of the funding rate over the period \(T\).

### Modified Black–Scholes Equation

Given the absence of a fixed expiration and the inclusion of a funding rate, the modified Black–Scholes equation for a
perpetual futures contract might omit \(T\) and adjust for \(c\), leading to a new valuation formula for \(V\), the
price of the futures contract:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + (r - c)S\frac{\partial
V}{\partial S} - (r - c)V = 0
$$

Here, \((r - c)\) adjusts the cost of carry to include the funding rate, effectively blending the risk-free rate with
the unique cost or benefit of holding a perpetual future in the crypto market.

### Volatility Adjustment

Given the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, an advanced volatility model like the Heston model can be incorporated,
which allows volatility to be stochastic rather than constant:

$$
d\sigma^2 = \kappa(\theta - \sigma^2)dt + \xi\sqrt{\sigma^2}dZ
$$

Where:

- \(\kappa\) is the rate at which \(\sigma^2\) reverts to its mean,
- \(\theta\) is the long-term variance mean,
- \(\xi\) is the volatility of the volatility,
- \(dZ\) is a Wiener process.

### Model Implementation

- **Data Collection**: Gather high-frequency data on spot prices, futures prices, and funding rates.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Use historical data to estimate model parameters, including \(\sigma\), \(\kappa\),
  \(\theta\), and \(\xi\).
- **Numerical Solutions**: Employ numerical methods to solve the modified Black–Scholes PDE, given its complexity,
  especially with stochastic volatility.

### Conclusion

Combining adapted spot-futures parity, a modified Black–Scholes framework for perpetual
futures, and advanced volatility modeling, provides a more accurate and nuanced approach for valuing cryptocurrency
futures. Implementing this model requires rigorous data analysis, parameter estimation, and computational methods to
navigate the unique dynamics of the cryptocurrency markets effectively; the requirements will be discussed in the next
section.
