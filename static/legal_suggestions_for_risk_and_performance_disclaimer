If the service is provided through a cloud-based API, open-source local code modules, or SDKs, you can adapt the disclaimer and terms and conditions to better suit the specific nature of my offering. Here are some suggestions on how you can adjust the text and some points to consider:

Specify the type of service: Clearly mention whether my service is a cloud-based API, open-source local code modules, or SDKs, so that users understand the nature of the service they are using.

Modify the responsibility clause: Depending on the nature of my service, you may need to change the responsibility clause to better reflect the extent of my liability. For instance, if my service is a cloud-based API or SDK, you might want to state that you are not responsible for any issues arising from the user's implementation, integration, or usage of the API or SDK.

Address data privacy and security: If my service involves data processing or storage, you should include information about data privacy and security measures. Explain how user data is handled, stored, and protected, and outline any data retention policies in place.

Third-party dependencies: If my service relies on third-party services, libraries, or APIs, you should disclose this information to the user. Inform them of any potential risks, limitations, or dependencies associated with using third-party components.

License and usage terms: If my service is open-source or involves the use of SDKs, you may need to include licensing terms and conditions. Specify the type of license my service is released under, and outline any restrictions on its use or distribution.

Support and maintenance: Clearly state the level of support and maintenance you provide for my service. This could include bug fixes, updates, and any assistance users can expect from you. Also, mention any limitations or restrictions on the support you provide.

Termination and suspension: If my service is subscription-based or has specific usage terms, outline the conditions under which the service may be terminated or suspended, and the process for doing so.

Ensure that my document complies with the relevant laws and regulations and adequately protects you and my users: Risk & Performance Disclaimer
